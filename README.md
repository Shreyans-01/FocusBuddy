# Timer for Google Chrome
A simple timer in the form of a Google Chrome extension.
The timer takes in a total time for which you wanna work and then a focus time which breaks down the total time into small time slots of focuses work at the end of which you are rewarded with a serotonin rush courtesy of a youtube video.
